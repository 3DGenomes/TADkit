1. In Safari, I do not see the 3D track (see fig1 attached). The rest of testing has been done with Chrome.
2. The project loader does not work with the json/tsvs I sent. The error is “undefined” coordinates in the TADkit bar (see fig2 attached).
3. When you have one project uploaded and try to upload a new one (via URL), TADkit adds the tracks to the previous project.
4. The color intensity in the distance track needs to be somehow scaled so to show differences of distances, now everything is too blue.
5. Restraint coloring does not work. When I click, all in 3D disappears.
6. Still see borders in the gene info panel (see figs attached).
7. The space between the tracks is still too large.
8. The “network” representation of the chromatin does not work (you can actually remove it).
