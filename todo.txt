+ The project loader does not work with the json/tsvs I sent. The error is “undefined” coordinates in the TADkit bar (see fig2 attached).
  Not, still a valid error. It basically does not recognizes the new coordinates and thus cannot find genes nor place the chromatin data correctly.

+ When you have one project uploaded and try to upload a new one (via URL), TADkit adds the tracks to the previous project.
  Still adds 10 tracks when I upload a new project from a page that had an “old” project loaded. If I upload it from scratch, then this problem does not exists.

+ The color intensity in the distance track needs to be somehow scaled so to show differences of distances, now everything is too blue.

+ Restraint coloring does not work. When I click, all in 3D disappears.

+ Still see borders in the gene info panel (see figs attached).
  Leave this for the end… not really relevant (just ugly).

+ The space between the tracks is still too large.

+ The “network” representation of the chromatin does not work (you can actually remove it).
  Just remove. Not important for now.
